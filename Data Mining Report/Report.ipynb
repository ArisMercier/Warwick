We read the data and use it to first plot several statistical diagrams, including Histograms, Scatter Diagrams and Violin Plots. We then compute four performance measures for each method, and use them to draw conclusions about the accuracy of our predictive models."

    "From the histogram, we see that the predicted Bike Count follows a relatively symmetric distribution, centred at approximately 750. This is in stark contrast to the tested Rented Bike Count, whose distribution is skewed positively. In particular, the very large number of occurances of zero (or very few) rented bikes is not captured accurately by the model. Finally, note that in the predicted Bike Count, we have instances of negative rented bikes. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "All three scatter diagrams have the residual along the y-axis. Since \n",
    "$$residual = y_{test} - y_{pred},$$\n",
    "ideally we would like the residual to be approximately zero, which would correspond to a high concetration of points on or around the x-axis. For the first scatter diagram, small bike counts correspond to residual values relatively close to zero. However, as the bike counts increase, so do the residual values, indicating that our model isn't very accurate. For the last two scatter diagrams, there is a significant proportion of points taking large positive or negative values, illustrating the same point. Also, note that the overwhelming majority of bike rentals happen when there is no rainfall (as one would expect). This means that there aren't enough data points for Rainfall(mm) $> 0$  to train the model, which also contributes to inaccurate predictions.\n",
